 * Boot splashes painted onto the panel. Both blobs are produced offline by
 * tools/gen_splash.py (PNG -> Floyd-Steinberg dither -> 4-bpp packed), then
 * embedded via CMake's EMBED_FILES so the firmware streams them straight
 * to epd_display() with no decode at runtime.
 *
 * Each call brings the panel up, refreshes (~30 s), and puts it back to
 * sleep -- safe to invoke either with the panel still off or already
 * initialised (epd_port_init is idempotent).

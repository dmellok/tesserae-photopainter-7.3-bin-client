/* Fill `dst` with a JSON document like:
 *   {"battery_mv":3950,"battery_pct":67,"rssi":-45,
 *    "ip":"192.168.50.234","fw_version":"0.2.0",
 *    "kind":"esp32_client","panel_w":800,"panel_h":480,
 *    "sleep_interval_s":900,"next_sleep_s":900,
 *    "wake_reason":"timer","sleep_until":1759264800}
 *
 * `sleep_interval_s` is the device's *configured* deep-sleep duration
 * (diagnostic). `next_sleep_s` is the deep-sleep duration the device is
 * about to enter -- usually identical, but firmwares that adjust their
 * own cadence (e.g. extend sleep on low battery) can differ. Both feed
 * Tesserae's smart-sync scheduler
 * (https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae/issues/10).
 *
 * `sleep_until` is the absolute unix timestamp (UTC seconds) the device
 * intends to wake. Pass 0 to OMIT the key entirely from the JSON --
 * the server treats absent and zero differently. Omit-don't-zero is the
 * graceful-degradation path for the first cold boot before NTP syncs:
 * the server falls back to its tolerance-window math
 * (receive_time + next_sleep_s, +/- 60 s) and the device earns no
 * worse than that until the next wake.
 *
 * `wake_reason` is a short string mapping of esp_reset_reason_t.
 *
 * Never fails -- unknown fields are emitted as 0 / empty string. The
 * caller's buffer should be at least 320 bytes; smaller is safe but
 * fields may be truncated. */

/*
 * Single-shot MQTT job grabber + one-shot heartbeat publisher.
 *
 * Each wake-up:
 *   1. connects to the broker
 *   2. subscribes to the update topic
 *   3. waits MQTT_WAIT_MS for the retained message
 *   4. returns the URL string (and any options) it carries
 *   5. tears down
 *
 * The Python listener publishes its job either as a bare URL string or
 * as a JSON object with a "url" field; we accept both, since either is
 * a one-line change on the publisher side.
